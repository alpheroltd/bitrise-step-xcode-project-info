summary: Extracts Xcode project info data to environment variables.

  ## Xcode Project Info
  This step will simply extract Xcode project information (Version and Build), and export them into environment variables prefixed with `XPI_`.
  
  Afterwards, you can use these environment variables in other steps (ie. sending message on Slack).

  ---

  #### **Note**
  This version is intended for use on projects created with Xcode 11 and onwards.
  If your project still uses an Info.plist to store the explicit version and build values then use **2.X.X** of this step.
  
  ---

  ### **Projects**
  When using an xcode project then you only need to provide a path to the xcodeproj file and the particular target to read from.
  The step will then read from the data and return the version information.


  ### **Workspaces**
  If you are using Xcode workspaces then use the `Workspace path` and `Workspace scheme name` inputs to qualify the target to read from.
  You must provide values for _**both**_ inputs, the workspace path alone is not enough to resolve the version and build values.
